<h3>Getting Started with Azure</h3>

<p>
We will begin this portion, with signing up and adding a resource group to our Azure account. In order to do this, go ahead and head to portal.azure.com, you will be redirected to a website where you will need a microsoft account. Once created, go ahead and follow the account creation prompts to finalize the account.

Once the account has been created, you will be redirected to the home page.
On the home page make sure to search and or select the button labeled as resource group. Once selected, we will click on 'create' and begin the creation of our new resource group.

Make sure, the correct Azure subscription is selected. Then make sure to give the resource goup a name. Once it has been given a name, choose the region you want the resource group to store its data. Once done, go ahead and click on 'next', where it will take you to the 'Tags' section. We can go ahead and leave the tags portion blank, if you would like to go ahead and make changes make sure to do so.

<p>
We need to make sure that they are both created within the same resource group. We are making sure to create a Virtual Machine on Windows 10 Pro Image, and Linux Ubuntu Image. The following settings should be similar for both virtual machines created. Make the virtual machines were created and deployed. Now you have successfully setup Azure and created Virtual Machines!
